## Version History

### v2.1.1 - 16.02.2026

#### Fixes
- Fixed Highlights not parenting correctly

### v2.1.0 - 14.02.2026

#### New Features
- Added `ESPInstance:SetEveryColor(Color, IncludeComponents)` to quickly update all colors at once
- **Box2D Component**: Added 2D bounding box ESP
  ```lua
  Box2D = {
      Enabled = true,
      Color = Color3.new(1, 1, 1),
      Thickness = 1,
      Transparency = 0,
      Filled = false
  }
  ```
- **Box3D Component**: Added 3D bounding box ESP
  ```lua
  Box3D = {
      Enabled = true,
      Color = Color3.new(1, 1, 1),
      Thickness = 1,
      Transparency = 0
  }
  ```
- **Skeleton Component**: Added Skeleton ESP (automatically detects R6 and R15, also works on NPCs)
  ```lua
  Skeleton = {
      Enabled = true,
      Color = Color3.new(1, 1, 1),
      Thickness = 1,
      Transparency = 0
  }
  ```
- Added `Box2D`, `Box3D`, `Skeleton` to `ESPLibrary.GlobalConfig`

#### Improvements
- Improved error handling in component update cycles (enable `getgenv().mstudio45_ESP_DEBUG` to see the error messages)
- `Model`, `TextModel`, `ESPType` are now read-only options (cannot be changed on already existing ESP instances)

#### Changes
- Each component was recoded to its own function for code readability and scalability
- Removed v1 source code from the repository (`source.lua`)

---

### v2.0.4 - 06.01.2026

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed Arrow component not properly hiding after calling `ESP:Hide()`

---

### v2.0.3 - 21.09.2025

#### New Features
- Added `BeforeUpdate` callback - executes before updating ESP components (after distance check)
  ```lua
  BeforeUpdate = function(self)
      -- Your code here, runs before component updates
      print("Updating ESP:", self.CurrentSettings.Name)
  end
  ```

- Added `AfterUpdate` callback - executes after updating all ESP components
  ```lua
  AfterUpdate = function(self)
      -- Your code here, runs after component updates
  end
  ```

#### Improvements
- Improved performance of the Render function

---

### v2.0.2 - 26.01.2025

#### New Features
- Added new ESPType: `Text` for text-only ESP displays
  ```lua
  ESPType = "Text"
  ```

- Added `GlobalConfig.IgnoreCharacter` option
  - When enabled, it uses Camera position instead of Character RootPart for calculations
  - Useful for spectator modes or camera-based games
  ```lua
  ESPLibrary.GlobalConfig.IgnoreCharacter = true
  ```

#### Improvements
- Improved Player Variables updater for better character tracking
- Render function now properly throws errors when issues occur for easier debugging
- Invisible `Tracers` and `Highlights` are now parented to `StorageFolder` to prevent hitting maximum render limits
- Improved memory management and performance

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed typo issue with `DistanceFrom` function
- Fixed pivot fetching of Models
- Fixed `ESPLibrary:Destroy()` not properly disconnecting connections in `Library.Connections`
- Improved cleanup on ESP destruction
